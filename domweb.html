        Dominic Fike, born on December 30, 1995, in Naples, Florida, is a multifaceted musician known for blending
        genres such as indie rock, hip-hop, and R&B. Growing up, Fike faced a tumultuous childhood with his mother
        frequently incarcerated, leading him to spend time in relatives' or friends' homes. Music became a central part
        of his life early on, as he learned guitar at age 10 and experimented with creating tracks on GarageBand with
        his siblings. Fike gained initial fame by uploading songs to SoundCloud, which eventually attracted the

        In 2018, while under house arrest, Fike recorded the EP Don't Forget About Me, Demos. Despite legal troubles,
        including a jail stint for violating his house arrest, his music caught the industry's attention, leading to a
        $4 million deal with Columbia Records. His breakout single, 3 Nights, achieved global acclaim, placing him on
        Spotify playlists and earning high praise from outlets like Billboard and Rolling Stone. Beyond his music, Fike
        has collaborated with artists such as BROCKHAMPTON, Kenny Beats, and Halsey. He also expanded into acting,
        appearing in HBO's Euphoria as the character Elliot. Today, Fike's artistic versatility and personal journey
        continue to resonate with fans worldwide.
